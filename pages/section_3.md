    - Download the record-video.py script from the following website.
      - https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/OpenCV-Python-Series/blob/master/src/lessons/record-video.py
      - I recommend placing it in the ~/DeepPiCar/driver/code directory for simplicityâ€™s sake as that is where many of the other Python scripts you will use reside, but you do not need to do so.
      - The easiest way to download the record-video script is to do the following:
        - Move to the correct directory: cd ~/DeepPiCar/driver/code
        - Create/open a new vi file: vi record-video.py
           - You will see an open, empty vi file
        - Copy all the Python script in the above link by highlighting it and using point/click.
        - Move to the open vi file and paste the contents of the script into the vi file with point/click.  Afterwards, the file will look like the below.
